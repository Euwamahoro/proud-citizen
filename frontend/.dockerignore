### Task 3: Update `docker-compose.yml` to run both services

Now, we need to tell Docker Compose about our new `frontend` service and how it should run alongside the `backend`.

**Action:**

1.  Open the `docker-compose.yml` file in your **project's root directory**.
2.  **Replace its entire content** with the following configuration:

```yaml
# You can remove the version line as it's obsolete
services:
  backend:
    build:
      context: ./backend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    env_file:
      - ./backend/.env
    container_name: proud-citizen-backend

  frontend:
    build:
      context: ./frontend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      # Map port 8080 on your machine to port 80 in the container
      - "8080:80"
    container_name: proud-citizen-frontend
    # This ensures the backend is started before the frontend
    depends_on:
      - backend
